	<p>Sports have always been a passion of mine. Ever since I was a kid my parents have raised me around sports. I grew up playing football, basketball, and baseball. My dad would always bond with me through the love of our favorite teams the patriots and redsox. We would go to big sporting events together and always watch every big game on televison. Sports has been a big part of my life and has also taught me many life lessons playing them. I have learned so much about working with your teammates to help reach our potential. Sports will forever be a big part of my life. </p>
